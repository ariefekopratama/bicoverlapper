Bicoverlapper started as a master's project that dealt with the general problem of visualizing overlapping (Overlapper).
Later, it evolved into a PhD thesis project to visualize microarray data biclustering results, integrating several sources of data to finally constitute a visual analysis support tool (BicOverlapper).
In the meantime, the solution was also applied to other fields of research, specially social networks in the areas of movie collaborations (FilmOverlapper) and paper co-authorships (ArtOverlapper)

Today, the main branch is evolving towards an integrative tool (analysis algorithms+visualization techniques)for visual analysis in systems biology approaches: SysOverlapper.
